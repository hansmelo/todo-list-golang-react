# Todo-list with Go, Fiber, Javascript, React

Go - language

Fiber - backend framework

Gorm - ORM library

Backend structure:

    main.go - the database connection, setup routes, configuration

    database/database.go - import of gorm and creation of variable DBConn

    models/todo.go - Data modeling with Todo struct and CRUD operations. 

Javascript - language

React - frontend framework

Antd components

Frontend structure:

    App.css - import antd.css

    App.js - with main page

    services/todoServices.js - integration with backend

    components/Todo*.jsx - React interactive components.

Conclusions:

Go is fast for creating an API Rest.

React, I need to improve my knowledge, but it is a nice modularized framework. It was enjoyable to work with.
